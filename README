An animal movement simulator inspired by University of Minnesota biologist Donald 
B. Siniff's PROGRAM SIMPLOT, 1967. 

Siniff's goal was to better understand how and why patterns of animal movement, as 
tracked by the automatic radio-tracking system he helped to build, differed from 
species to species and from time to time. 

The goal of this program is to better understand why Siniff and other wildlife biologists
of his generation approached the study of animal behavior and ecology the way they
did. 

The simulation logic and aesthetic of this version are modeled after Siniff's original 
FORTRAN code, as published in his 1967 dissertation; the language, interface and output 
medium are quite a bit different.

core:
* simplot.js -- javascript for controls, simulation, and plotting
* simplot.html -- html code for controls and canvas
* simplot.css -- styling


extra:
* angle-dists.py -- python code to generate circular normal (Von Mises) 
	distributions that are hard-coded into simplot.js and appear as drop-down 
	menu options in the app under "probability distributions"
