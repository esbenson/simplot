An animal movement simulator inspired by University of Minnesota biologist Donald 
B. Siniff's PROGRAM SIMPLOT, 1967. Siniff's goal was to better understand how and
why patterns of animal movement, as tracked by the automatic radio-tracking system
he helped to build, differed from species to species and from time to time. The
goal of this program is to better understand why Siniff and other wildlife biologists
of his generation approached the study of animal behavior and ecology the way they
did. 

The simulation logic and aesthetic of this version are modeled after Siniff's original 
FORTRAN code; the language, interface and output medium are quite a bit different.
